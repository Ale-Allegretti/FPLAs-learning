Knowledge of models and methodologies to design digital systems.

Knowledge of methodologies for the analysis and design of conbinational circuits and asynchronous and synchronous sequential circuits

**Contents**:

- The course is held in the second semester, from February to June.
Design layers of a digital machine: block description of a machine and verbal description of its behavior. Signal classification. Logic circuits as networks of switches. Gates.

- Binary representation of information. Properties of codes. Codes to represents texts and numbers.Classification of digital systems: combinational, asynchronous and synchronous circuits.
- Combinational logic circuits. Functions, truth tables, and logic diagram views. Commutation Algebra: operations, expressions, and equivalence theorems. Design and analysis through canonical forms and standard forms. Real combinatorial networks: transient and steady-state behavior. 

- Gate-level minimization with Karnaugh maps.

- Standard combinational logic circuits: decoder and multiplexer. Design by means of decoders and OR gates. Shannon's expansion theorem and design by means of multiplexers. Programmable circuits. ROM as programmable combinational circuits. Three-state buffer.

- Binary arithmetic with unsigned and signed numbers. 2-complements representation for signed numbers. Half adder, full adder, and n-bit adder. Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU).  

- The asynchronous sequential logic circuit as a combinational circuit with direct feedback. Behaviors, constraints for correct use and techniques aimed at a priori removal of undesired behaviors. Finite state machine (FSM); description of the behavior by means of state diagram and state table. Design and analysis of asynchronous sequential logic circuits.

- Asynchronous sequential logic circuits for binary memories: latches and flip-flops.

- The synchronous sequential logic circuit as a combinational circuit with feedback loops based on flip-flops. Timing constraints to choose the clock period. Formal design method for circuits with D flip-flops.

- Standard synchronous circuits: registers, shift registers, and counters. Examples of design of synchronous logic circuits containing registers, counters, and shift registers and not based on the conventional graph-based method.
